### PID Controller by python 

- This project is a combination of ideas found on the web, along with some ideas that arose during control classes. The idea is to create a classic PID controller, along with a PID obtained directly from data from a level plant. It's also a great project for conducting tests with object-oriented programming, so it's something that is still in progress!
